# typescript_knowledge-share

This repository was created for the knowledge share 'Typescript: Types demystified'

-----------------------------------

The graphql server was created in Javascript and then migrated to Typescript. In this repository you'll find a basic setup to run and debug a server written in Typescript.

The website contains examples of the Typescript type system. A good starting point is the Examples folder.
The website was only intended to be used for the knowledge share and is best viewed on a QHD (1440p) screen.

-----------------------------------

To run the code:
- Make sure you have node installed
- Start graphql server:
  - Open a terminal and go to the /gql folder
  - Run 'yarn' or 'npm install' to install the dependencies
  - Run 'yarn start' to start the server
- Start graphql website:
  - Open a terminal and go to the /website folder
  - Run 'yarn' or 'npm install' to install the dependencies
